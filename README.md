## About This Integration

This custom component allows you to integrate your HDG Bavaria boiler (e.g., HDG Euro, K-Series, Compact, etc., that support the web interface) into Home Assistant. It provides sensor entities to monitor various parameters of your heating system and number entities to control certain settings. The integration polls data in configurable groups and intervals to balance data freshness with the load on the boiler's controller.

## Features

- **Sensor Data**: Access a wide range of data points from your boiler, including:
  - Temperatures (boiler, buffer, flue gas, outside, heating circuits, etc.)
  - Status information (boiler state, pump status, operating modes)
  - Operational values (oxygen levels, air flap positions, fan speeds)
  - Counters and statistics (operating hours, energy consumption)
- **Control Capabilities**: Adjust specific boiler settings through Home Assistant:
  - Heating circuit target temperatures (e.g., day/night setpoints)
  - Parallel shift for heating curves
  - Other configurable parameters (depending on your boiler model and `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS`)
- **Configurable Polling**: Fine-tune scan intervals for different groups of data to optimize performance and data relevance.
- **Custom Services**:
  - `set_node_value`: Directly set values for specific HDG nodes.
  - `get_node_value`: Retrieve raw values from the integration's data cache.
- **Device Diagnostics**: Access diagnostic information through Home Assistant to aid in troubleshooting.
- **Dynamic Entity Creation**: Entities are created based on a comprehensive `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` map, allowing for flexibility and extensibility.

## Prerequisites

- An HDG Bavaria boiler with a network interface and an accessible web API. Please consult your boiler's manual or HDG service partner to ensure API access is enabled and to understand any implications.
- A **static IP address** assigned to your HDG boiler on your local network. This is crucial for reliable communication.
- Home Assistant version 2023.x or newer (recommended).

## Installation

### Via HACS (Recommended)

1.  **Ensure HACS is installed.** If not, follow the HACS installation guide.
2.  **Add as a custom repository:**
    - Go to HACS in your Home Assistant.
    - Click on "Integrations".
    - Click the three dots in the top right corner and select "Custom repositories".
    - In the "Repository" field, enter the URL of this GitHub repository: `https://github.com/banter240/hdg_bavaria_homeassistant` (replace `banter240` with your actual GitHub username or the correct path if forked).
    - Select "Integration" as the category.
    - Click "Add".
3.  **Install the integration:**
    - Search for "HDG Bavaria Boiler" in HACS.
    - Click on the integration.
    - Click "Download" and follow the prompts.
4.  **Restart Home Assistant.** This is important for the integration to be loaded.

### Manual Installation

1.  Download the latest release from the Releases page
2.  Extract the downloaded archive.
3.  Copy the `custom_components/hdg_boiler` directory into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory. If `custom_components` doesn't exist, create it.
4.  Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

After installation (and restarting Home Assistant), the integration can be configured via the UI:

1.  Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
2.  Click the **+ ADD INTEGRATION** button in the bottom right.
3.  Search for "HDG Bavaria Boiler" and select it.
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions:
    - **Host IP Address or Hostname**: Enter the static IP address or hostname of your HDG boiler.
    - **Alias for the Boiler (optional)**: Provide a friendly name for your boiler (e.g., "Euro 50", "Kellerheizung"). This will be used in device and entity naming. If left blank, the IP address will be used.

The integration will attempt to connect to your boiler and perform an initial data fetch.

### Integration Options

Once the integration is added, you can adjust its settings:

1.  Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**.
2.  Find the "HDG Bavaria Boiler" integration card.
3.  Click on **CONFIGURE**.
4.  You can adjust the following:
    - **Scan Intervals**: Modify the polling frequency (in seconds) for different groups of data:
      - Realtime Core Values
      - General Status Values
      - Config/Counters Part 1, 2, and 3
        Shorter intervals provide more up-to-date data but increase the load on the boiler's controller. Longer intervals are suitable for less frequently changing data.
    - **Enable Detailed Timestamp Logging**: Activate verbose logging for polling cycles, useful for troubleshooting. Be aware that this can generate large log files.

## Supported Entities

Entities are dynamically created based on the `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` within the integration. The availability of specific entities depends on your boiler model and its configuration.

### Sensors

A variety of sensor entities are created, including:

- **Temperatures**: Outside temperature, boiler temperature, buffer temperatures (top, middle, bottom), flue gas temperature, heating circuit flow/return temperatures, etc. (Typically `device_class: temperature`, unit: `Â°C` or `K`).
- **Status & Enum Values**: Boiler status (e.g., "Ready", "Heating-up", "Fault"), pump status (On/Off), operating modes, selected fuel type, etc. (Displayed as text).
- **Percentages**: Material quantity, air flap positions, fan speeds, O2 levels, buffer charge state, etc. (Typically `unit_of_measurement: %`).
- **Counters & Durations**: Operating hours, energy consumption (kWh, MWh), maintenance timers, etc. (Various `device_class` like `duration`, `energy`, `state_class: total_increasing`).
- **Pressures**: Negative pressure in the boiler (Typically `device_class: pressure`, unit: `Pa`).
- **Diagnostic Info**: Software versions, MAC address, system labels.

### Number Entities (Controls)

Number entities allow you to view and adjust specific settings on your boiler. These typically correspond to configurable parameters. Examples include:

- **`number.hdg_boiler_<alias>_tagbetrieb_raumtemperatur_soll`**: Target room temperature for day mode (Heating Circuit 1).
- **`number.hdg_boiler_<alias>_hk1_parallelverschiebung`**: Parallel shift for the heating curve (Heating Circuit 1).
- **`number.hdg_boiler_<alias>_hk1_steilheit`**: Slope of the heating curve (Heating Circuit 1).
- Other setpoints or configuration values as defined in `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` with `ha_platform: "number"` and `writable: true`.

These entities will appear under the device for your HDG boiler and can be added to your dashboards.

## Services

This integration provides custom services for more direct interaction with the boiler's nodes.

### `hdg_boiler.set_node_value`

Allows you to set a specific value for a writable HDG node.

**Service Data:**

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Example  | Required |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :------- |
| `node_id` | The base ID of the HDG Node to set (e.g., '6022'). Must correspond to an entity defined as a 'number' platform with write access in `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS`.            | `"6022"` | Yes      |
| `value`   | The value to send to the node. It will be validated against the entity's configured type (int, float1, float2), range, and step from its `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` entry. | `"21.5"` | Yes      |

**Important Notes:**

- Use this service with caution. Setting incorrect values could potentially affect your boiler's operation.
- The `node_id` refers to the base ID (e.g., "6022" for `hk1_soll_normal`). The integration handles any necessary API formatting.
- The service relies on the `SENSOR_DEFINITIONS` for the specified `node_id` to determine if it's writable and to perform validation (min/max value, step, data type for API).

### `hdg_boiler.get_node_value`

Retrieves the current raw string value of a specific node from the integration's internal data cache. This cache is updated by polling the HDG boiler or immediately after a successful `set_node_value` call for the same node.

**Service Data:**

| Field     | Description                                                                                               | Example   | Required |
| :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :------- |
| `node_id` | The base ID of the HDG Node to retrieve (e.g., '22003'). Numeric inputs will be treated as strings by HA. | `"22003"` | Yes      |

**Return Value:**

This service call, when executed via Developer Tools, will show the response in the "Service Call Response" section. The response will contain a `value` key with the raw string value of the node as stored in the coordinator, or `null` if the node is not found in the cache.

Example response:

```json
{
  "value": "75.3"
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

If you encounter issues:

1.  **Check Boiler Connectivity**: Ensure your HDG boiler is powered on, connected to your network, and has a stable IP address. Verify that the web interface/API is accessible from your network (e.g., by trying to open its IP address in a web browser).
2.  **Verify Configuration**: Double-check the Host IP address in the integration configuration.
3.  **Enable Debug Logging**:
    - Go to the integration's **Options** (Settings -> Devices & Services -> HDG Bavaria Boiler -> CONFIGURE).
    - Enable "Detailed Timestamp Logging".
    - Restart Home Assistant or reload the integration.
4.  **Examine Logs**: Check the Home Assistant logs (Settings -> System -> Logs -> Load Full Logs) for messages related to `custom_components.hdg_boiler`.
5.  **Developer Tools**:
    - **States**: Inspect the state and attributes of your HDG boiler entities. Attributes often contain the raw HDG node ID and other diagnostic info.
    - **Services**: Use the `hdg_boiler.get_node_value` service to query raw values for specific nodes.
6.  **Diagnostics**:
    - Go to **Settings** -> **Devices & Services**.
    - Find your HDG Boiler device.
    - Click the three dots on the device card and select "Download diagnostics". This file contains redacted configuration and state information that can be helpful for debugging.
